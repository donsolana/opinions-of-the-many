Web Dashboard For The Big Brother Naija Sentiment Analysis Project.

## Introduction :wave:
In this project I build on top of a [previous project](https://github.com/donsolana/BBN_Sentiments.py), it provides a user interface to analyse tweets from the previously concluded ***'Big Brother Naija'*** reality TV show.

## Structure Of The App 

Its an R shiny App it is divided into four pages. 

1. A home page to get the overview
2. A page dedicated to analysing common words 
3. Another dedicated to analysing engagements i.e retweets, likes
4. Finally, a page dedicated to searching and view tweets. You can also sort these tweets  by their likes and retweet count

### Tooling :hammer:
